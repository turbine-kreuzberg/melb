# MelB

During the lockdowns, domestic violence has increased sharply, although the level is unfortunately always very high. It
is difficult for victims to ask for help because they often cannot withdraw from their tormentors, e.g. shared
apartment, no own bank card, cell phone is checked regularly, victims are separated from their families and friends by
their perpetrators etc....
